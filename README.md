A notebook exploring the network described by the ICIJ Panama Papers leak.

To run the notebook, you will need to download the leak information from [https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/database](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/database), extracted and placed in the data/ directory. This is because github limits the size of files to 100mb.
